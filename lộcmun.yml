Learn how we count contributions. Less      More
This is your contribution graph. Your first ■ is for joining GitHub and you’ll earn more as you make additional contributions. More contributions means a darker green square for that day. Over time, your chart might start looking ￼something like this.

We have a quick guide that will show you how to create your first repository and earn more green squares!
